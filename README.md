# Objectives

In this exercise, you will develop a very simple one-page website to manage a chatbot. The video below shows what the program you need to code should do.
Please note that the video is only an exemple (rather good), reproducing it precisely is not the goal, it might take you (too) long, do not hesitate to be creative if you feel like it.
Use your best judgement to provide a clean and simple design.

# Video

![Sample Video](assets/demo.mp4)

# Constraints

- All data is hosted locally
- Focus on code readability, modularity and abstraction
- Use a modular SASS architecture and follow the best CSS practices

It is OK to use packages or frameworks, but don't make everything out of packages. Show us that you know how to code in vanilla JS and CSS.

# Bonus points

- UX improvements
- Update browser history to display a single intent
- Exceptional design
- Website compatibility with IE10
- Best accessibility of the platform (WAI-ARIA, keyboard navigation)

# Evaluation criteria

- Knowledge in vanilla JS and JS architecture
- Knowledge in CSS, CSS/Sass architecture, HTML5
- Overall development rigor, coding style and good practices

We know that this website can always be improved upon and receive many more features, this is not the goal. Showing your skills and rigor is key.
